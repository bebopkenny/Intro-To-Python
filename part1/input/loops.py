Loops
For Loops and While Loops
Loops are just ways to repeat things!

For Loops:
    Think of a for loop as a way 
    to repeat something a specific 
    number of times or for every item in a list.

While Loops:
    A while loop is for when you want something 
    to keep happening as long as a condition is true.
